//Assignment 6 
Title: Design and implement the Heap Sort algorithm to efficiently sort an array of integers in 
ascending order. The implementation should be optimized for time and space complexity and 
should clearly demonstrate the working principles of heap data structures (min-heap or max-heap 
as applicable) 
def heapify(arr, n, i): 
"""Ensures the subtree rooted at index i is a max-heap.""" 
largest = i 
left = 2 * i + 1     # left child index 
right = 2 * i + 2    # right child index 
# Check if left child exists and is greater than root 
if left < n and arr[left] > arr[largest]: 
largest = left 
# Check if right child exists and is greater than current largest 
if right < n and arr[right] > arr[largest]: 
largest = right 
# If largest is not the root, swap and continue heapifying 
if largest != i: 
arr[i], arr[largest] = arr[largest], arr[i] 
heapify(arr, n, largest)

n = len(arr) 
# Build max-heap 
for i in range(n // 2 - 1, -1, -1):

# Extract elements from heap one by one 
for i in range(n - 1, 0, -1): 
# Swap root (largest) with the last element 
arr[0], arr[i] = arr[i], arr[0] 
# Heapify the reduced heap
