Title: Maximize Profit by Shipping Partial Orders (Fractional Knapsack) Problem Statement: 
You run a shipping company and need to load a truck with parcels of different weights and 
profits. The truck has a limited weight capacity. Write a program to choose parcels (even 
partially) to maximize profit using the Fractional Knapsack strategy. 
def fractional_knapsack(weights, profits, capacity): 
ratio = [(profits[i] / weights[i], weights[i], profits[i]) for i in range(len(weights))] 
ratio.sort(reverse=True, key=lambda x: x[0]) 
total_profit = 0 
selected_items = [] 
for r, w, p in ratio: 
if capacity <= 0: 
break 
if w <= capacity: 
capacity -= w 
total_profit += p 
selected_items.append((w, p, 1.0)) 
else: 
fraction = capacity / w 
total_profit += p * fraction 
selected_items.append((w, p, fraction)) 
capacity = 0 
return total_profit, selected_items 
def input_data(): 
n = int(input("Enter number of parcels: ")) 
weights = [] 
profits = [] 
for i in range(n): 
w = float(input(f"Enter weight of parcel {i+1}: ")) 
p = float(input(f"Enter profit of parcel {i+1}: ")) 
weights.append(w) 
profits.append(p) 
capacity = float(input("Enter truck capacity: ")) 
return weights, profits, capacity 
def display_result(selected, max_profit): 
print("\nSelected parcels:") 
for w, p, frac in selected: 
print(f"Weight: {w}, Profit: {p}, Taken: {frac*100:.2f}%") 
print(f"\nMaximum Profit: {max_profit:.2f}\n") 
# Main menu loop 
while True: 
print("\n=== Fractional Knapsack Menu ===") 
print("1. Enter Data and Calculate") 
print("2. Exit") 
choice = input("Enter choice: ") 
if choice == "1": 
weights, profits, capacity = input_data() 
max_profit, selected = fractional_knapsack(weights, profits, capacity) 
display_result(selected, max_profit) 
elif choice == "2": 
print("Exiting... Goodbye!") 
break 
else: 
print("Invalid choice. Try again.") 
//OUTPUT 
1. Enter Data and Calculate 
2. Exit 
Enter choice: 1 
Enter number of parcels: 3 
Enter weight of parcel 1: 10 
Enter profit of parcel 1: 60 
Enter weight of parcel 2: 20 
Enter profit of parcel 2: 100 
Enter weight of parcel 3: 30 
Enter profit of parcel 3: 120 
Enter truck capacity: 50 
Selected parcels: 
Weight: 10.0, Profit: 60.0, Taken: 100.00% 
Weight: 20.0, Profit: 100.0, Taken: 100.00% 
Weight: 30.0, Profit: 120.0, Taken: 66.67% 
Maximum Profit: 240.00
